      "<p>Hey there! I'm Adrian Payne. Born and raised in Ireland but now living in the beautiful city of Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I've always had an interest in singing and musical theatre though never actually got around to doing all that much with it up until now. I recently started taking singing lessons and want to share the results with you as I go along. Maybe one day I can quit the day job and do this full time! Right? Right??</p>"
