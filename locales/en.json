Born and raised in Ireland but now living in the beautiful city of Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I've always had an interest in singing and musical theatre though never actually got around to doing all that much with it up until now. I recently started taking singing lessons and want to share the results with you as I go along. Maybe one day I can quit the day job and do this full time! Right? Right??</p>"

        "question": "What gear do you use to record audio?",
        "answer": "<p>I switch between using a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt-usb\"><em>RØDE NT-USB</em></a> and a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt1-a\"><em>RØDE NT1-A</em></a> condenser mic put through a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-2i2\"><em>Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</em></a>. Sadly, my laptop has trouble with the latter combination so I only record with that on my PC.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What gear do you use to record video?",
        "answer": "<p>I use a <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam\"><em>Logitech Pro Stream C922</em></a>. It's okay but it's not really made for this type of video recording so I don't get the quality I'd like with it. Looking out for a cheap Canon T3i (600D)!</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What software do you use to create videos?",
        "answer": "<p>While I'd love to get my hands on Adobe Premiere and After Affects, I currently use <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/\"><em>Wondershare Filmora</em></a> which I picked up cheap in a deal. It gets the job done for now!</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What software do you use to edit audio?",
        "answer": "<p>I use the completely free program <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.audacityteam.org/\"><em>Audacity</em></a> for all audio editing.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where are you from?",
        "answer": "<p>Born and raised in a small seaside town in the south east of Ireland. So I love the wind and the ocean!</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where did you get your website?",
        "answer": "<p>All me and feedback/questions welcome! :) When not singing, I'm a web developer, which is what I learned in that blurry university period of life. The code is up on <a v-on:click=\"toGithub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/dazulu/music\">Github</a> if you like that sort of thing.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Have you ever had voice training?",
        "answer": "<p>I started getting voice lessons recently with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.birtekoenigshoff.de/\">birtekoenigshoff.de</a>. She's great! Up until last year I had no training apart from listening to my dad rehearsing musical theatre when I was a kid. It stuck with me and I love that stuff!</p>"

      {
        "question": "How did you get here?",
        "answer": "<p>If my dad hadn't joined a musical society when I was a kid, I don't think I would be. Thanks to him coming home rehearsing songs from Rodgers & Hammerstein and Gilbert & Sullivan to name a few, I picked up a liking for musicals and singing.</p>"
