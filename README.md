## What is this?
This is a personal web site to support my singing on https://www.patreon.com/adrianpayne.

I'm probably going to ship this as a statically rendered site. Depends what functionality is needed along the way.

## Tech Stack
- Using Nuxt.js https://nuxtjs.org/
  - Uses Vue 2 https://github.com/vuejs/vue
  - Uses Webpack https://github.com/webpack/webpack
